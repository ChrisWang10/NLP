# TF-IDF

## term frequency- inverse document frequency

 tf-idf weight is a weight often used in information retrieval and text mining. This weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus.

**The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.**

1. ​	 Term Frequency (TF) 

    the number of times a word appears in a document, divided by the total number of words in that document; 

2. ​      Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) 

    log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it
